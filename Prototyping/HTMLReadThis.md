# Calendar HTML
<notes from KS about files in the Prototyping folder>

* Note that all text for now is placeholders
  * Placeholding text will be replaced once items can be added and agreed upon
* Colors will be changed and updated for more clean look after the basic html & css is mostly complete.
  * Color Pallete ideas will be figured later on. Completing the "feel" of the webpage requires:
    * Font (Chosen font can change the feel signifigantly)
    * Wanted Look
    * Icons
    
* Make sure to provide feedback and wants in the discord OR google doc
